# Promise and Testing Unit Test Problems

Here are some important notes about this test.

1. When you do this project, _do not use the mocha command_. Instead, **use the
   npm test command**! This is the way that we can test that you wrote tests.
2. Do **NOT** modify the files in the "test" directory. _All_ of your work will
   happen in the files in _this_ directory: **01-create-a-delay-promise.js**,
   **02-create-a-use-async-await.js**, and **03-unit-test-a-class.js**.

## Usage

1. Clone the assessment repository from
   https://github.com/appacademy/assessment-promise-and-testing-js-starter.
2. `cd` into the folder and `npm install` to install dependencies
3. **Run the tests by typing `npm test`**. DO NOT JUST USE `mocha`.
4. Your objective is to implement the code in each of the following JavaScript
   files so that when you run Mocha using `npm test`, all tests pass.
   * In **01-create-a-delay-promise.js**, you will write a Promise that allows
     to delay for a certain amount of time.
   * In **02-create-a-use-async-await.js**, you will write a function that uses
     the `async` and `await` keywords to perform delayed logging.
   * In **03-unit-test-a-class.js** you will write Mocha tests to test a class.
     **You will write your tests in that file, NOT in the "test" directory.**
     Please, do not modify the files in the "test" directory.


## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

2. Zip up your folder
